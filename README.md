# 🗣️ Speech Recognition to Text Converter

This project is a lightweight **Speech Recognition System** that listens to spoken input and converts it into real-time transcribed text using modern speech processing libraries. It is designed to demonstrate the fundamentals of speech-to-text conversion with a focus on clarity, speed, and usability.

## 📌 Features

- 🎙️ Real-time voice input  
- 📝 Converts speech to text with high accuracy  
- ⚙️ Lightweight and easy to run locally  
- 🧠 Built using state-of-the-art speech recognition libraries  

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **SpeechRecognitio** – for processing microphone input
- **PyAudio** – to capture real-time audio
